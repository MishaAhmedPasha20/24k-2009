ALGORITHM:
TASK 1: Implement an algorithm for determining if Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

1.	Ask the user to enter N
2.	Ask the user to enter n
3.	If n % N = 0, then N is the divisor of n, otherwise N is not the divisor of n
4.	If N % 2 = 0, then N is even, otherwise N is odd
5.	Display the Results
