PSEUDOCODE

TASK 2: Take three variables as input and add them without using the + operator.

START
//INPUT
INPUT number1
INPUT number2
INPUT number3
//PROCESS STEPS 
Set Answer to [(-number1-number2-number3) * (-1)]
//OUTPUT
Display Answer
END
 
TASK 3: CREATE A SMALL CALCULATOR WHICH ONLY DOES ‘+’ OR ‘- ‘OPERATIONS. (HINT: TAKE THREE VARIABLE INPUTS WITH ONE BEING USED FOR THE OPERATOR)

START
// INPUT/ OUTPUT
INPUT number1
INPUT number2
INPUT operator (‘+’ or ‘- ‘)
// CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
IF operator is ‘+’ THEN 
     Answer = number1 + number2
ELSE 
     Answer = number1 – number2
END

ALGORITHM

TASK 1: Implement an algorithm for determining if Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.

Ask the user to enter N
Ask the user to enter n
If n % N = 0, then N is the divisor of n, otherwise N is not the divisor of n
If N % 2 = 0, then N is even, otherwise N is odd

TASK 3: Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+, -, *, /, %)

Ask the user to enter Number1
Ask the user to enter Operator
Ask the user to enter Number2
If Operator is ‘+’, set Answer to Number1 + Number2
If Operator is ‘-’, set Answer to Number1 - Number2
If Operator is ‘*’, set Answer to Number1 * Number2
If Operator is ‘/’, set Answer to Number1 / Number2
If Operator is ‘%’, set Answer to Number1 % Number2
